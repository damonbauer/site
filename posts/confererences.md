pageTitle: Random, Unorganized Thoughts on Conferences

I knew it would be difficult to be around strangers all day. I didn't think it would be _this_ difficult. Seemingly _every_ interaction is with a stranger, so you're starting over at "zero" each time you start a new conversation.

I have been to 3 different conferences, and I can say with confidence that a talks main aim is not to teach you something new. Instead they exist to get you to think about something or try something new. Don't expect to walk out of a talk with a sure-fire way to solve a problem in your project.

Since talks are more "high-level", the value of a conference is in connecting with the other attendees. However, the first point (above) kind of nullifies any connections for me. I'm a 4 on the enneagram so I value genuine, authentic relationships and **strongly** dislike small talk. I am dying to get past it and into something real, but the nature of conferences (fast paced, crowded, go-go-go) make it a poor environment for getting anything other than surface conversations.

I feel sort of "left out". I suppose it is because I am not into tech as much as other people. I like development, I am good at it, I like problem solving, I care about the user... but at the end of the day, I enjoy being with my family, spending time in & around our home, and living a quiet, disconnected life.

I don't understand the obsession with stickers.

It's ironic that a tech conference intentionally _removes_ technology in an effort to bring people together: lunch at circular tables, improv, board games.
